The former portfolio for Kristopher Skelton. As I have been working largely in backend development the past several years for NOAA, and there is no way to demonstrate that to the world, I am removing the code from this site. There's no sense in having you, the interested party, think that my coding skill is relegated to demos and small one-page projects; especially if you're here to consider me for employment.
