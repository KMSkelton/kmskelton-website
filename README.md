# kmskelton-website
### The repository for my portfolio site at
[kmskelton.com](https://kmskelton.com)

This site is currently hosted with Netlify. Included in my hosting package are:
* Excellent customer support
  * All chat logs are forwarded to my email address as soon as the connection is interrupted. 
  * This means I can continue the dialog away from the in-window chat client if needed.
* HTTPS
  * It took two steps to redirect my DNS and Netlify's wizard set up HTTPS
* Continuous Integration
  * With my previous host I had to upload site changes separate from my github commits. 
  * Now when I pull into Master my site updates before I can refresh that page
