      <h5>HTML and CSS have been constant companions for over two decades. Books and tutorials comprised the bulk of my "training" until I attended on-site classes at Code Fellows in Seattle. There I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and completed an
        8-week intensive course in Front End Web Development.</h5><br />
      <h5>While I'm still a junior-level developer, I have a solid training base, know how to ask the questions to figure out a solution to my problem, and know how to use the tools. That's a far cry from my experience with self-teaching.</h5><br />
      <h5>I offer passion for responsive web design. I build for a quality mobile experience that takes advantage of media queries and relative sizing. The experience improves with the added real-estate of a full size monitor. HTML and CSS comprise the core
        of my skillset; animations and SASS expand these capabilities.  JavaScript (along with jQuery and Angular) add interactivity.</h5>

    <h6>Before I changed careers to web development I worked for over 13 years in all aspects of the medical billing cycle: customer service (answering questions about patient bills), registration, payment posting, appealing denials, and most recently I was a clinic biller. This position required that I review patient accounts, keep up with all the changes to insurance coverages (including all of the new plans created by the Affordable Care Act), as well as review physician claims before they were electronically sent out.</h6>
    <h6>I have an Associate of Arts and Science degree in aerospace engineering. That educational path didn't pan out, so while working full time I went back to school via Washington State Univerity's Distance Degree Progam (which has since changed names at least twice). Upon completion my GPA was high enough to have "summa cum laude" added to my Bachelor of Arts in humanities. Beyond that I completed a Master of Arts degree in public (applied) history. My thesis is titled "Trapped in the Fur Trade: Debt Bondage in the Rocky Mountains 1822-1827."</h6><br />
    <p>I have dabbled in photography and editing in GIMP and Photoshop. The background image on this site is a photo I took of a sunset in Edmonds, WA in 2014 and I use it with my permission.<p>
