      <h6>Kristopher Skelton is a front end web developer who specializes in responsive web design. He burned through “Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML in 14 Days” just after high school and kept up with web development as a hobby. His career has spanned medical billing and professional history, as well as paraprofessional education. In 2015 he successfully completed certificate programs in JavaScript and advanced Front-End Web Development through Code Fellows in his hometown of Seattle. Recent projects include technologies such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, Node, Express, Mongo, Sass, React and Git version control. He enjoys solving complex problems as part of a small team. His current hobbies include table top games such as 7 Wonders, Dominion and Power Grid, and he float-tested his twenty-sided dice to ensure fair rolls during D&D games.
</h6><br />
      <h6>Though still a junior-level developer, he has a solid training base, knows how to ask the questions to figure out a solution to his problems, and knows how to use development environment tools. Before he changed careers to web development he worked for over 13 years in all aspects of the medical billing cycle, mostly in the corporate setting. <br />
        He has an AAS in aerospace engineering and a MA in applied history. This diverse educational background combines with years in the professional world to influence all of his work. He is comfortable considering a problem from multiple angles while making quick decisions. He takes ownership of these decisions and follows them through until they are completed.</h6>
