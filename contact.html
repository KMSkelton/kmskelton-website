            <h5>HTML and CSS were the base of my coding knowledge for over two decades. Books and tutorials comprised the bulk of my training until I attended on-site classes at Code Fellows in Seattle. There I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and completed an
        8-week intensive course in Front End Web Development. I completed a 10-week course in advanced JavaScript (Angular) several months later.</h5><br />
            <h5>Though I have completed coding bootcamps, have TA'd intro to web development courses and am working full time as a JavaScript developer, I have a lot to learn. I have a solid training base, know how to ask the questions to figure out a solution to my problem, and know how to use the tools.</h5><br />
            <h5>I build for a quality mobile experience that takes advantage of media queries and relative sizing. The experience improves with the added real-estate of a full size monitor. In my professional coding I ensure that our video content and related features are available on as many platforms as possible.</h5>

            <h6>Before I changed careers to software development I worked for over 13 years in all aspects of the medical billing cycle. I tell my former coworkers that I traded medical codes for JavaScript code. In addition to podcasts and LinkedIn groups I continue my software studying via online courses. These include Angular, JavaScript's architecture (the good parts and the weird parts), NodeJS, Unity's C# implementation, and Ruby on Rails. </h6>
            <h6>I have an Associate of Arts and Science degree in aerospace engineering; that educational path didn't pan out. After several years away from school, and while working full time, I enrolled in Washington State Univerity's Distance Degree Progam. Upon completion my GPA was high enough to have "summa cum laude" included on my Bachelor of Arts in humanities. Beyond that I completed a Master of Arts degree in public (applied) history. My thesis is titled "Trapped in the Fur Trade: Debt Bondage in the Rocky Mountains 1822-1827."</h6><br />
            <p>I have dabbled in photography and editing in GIMP and Photoshop. The background image on this site is a photo I took of a sunset in Edmonds, WA in 2014 and I use it with my permission.
