            <h5>HTML and CSS were the base of my coding knowledge for over two decades. Books and tutorials comprised the bulk of my training until I attended on-site classes at Code Fellows in Seattle. There I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and completed an
        8-week intensive course in Front End Web Development. I completed a 10-week course in advanced JavaScript (Angular) several months later.</h5><br />
            <h5>Though I have completed coding bootcamps, have TA'd intro to web development courses and am working full time as a JavaScript developer, I have a lot to learn. I have a solid training base, know how to ask the questions to figure out a solution to my problem, and know how to use the tools.</h5><br />
            <h5>I build for a quality mobile experience that takes advantage of media queries and relative sizing. The experience improves with the added real-estate of a full size monitor. In my professional coding I ensure that our video content and related features are available on as many platforms as possible.</h5>

            <h6>Before I changed careers to software development I worked for over 13 years in all aspects of the medical billing cycle; I traded medical codes for JavaScript code. In addition to podcasts and LinkedIn groups I continue my software studying via online courses. Ongoing studies include Angular, JavaScript's architecture (the good parts and the weird parts), NodeJS, Unity's C# implementation, and Ruby on Rails. </h6>
            <h6>I have an Associate of Arts and Science degree in aerospace engineering; that educational path didn't pan out. After several years away from school, and while working full time, I enrolled in Washington State Univerity's Distance Degree Progam. Upon completion my GPA was high enough to have "summa cum laude" included on my Bachelor of Arts in humanities. Beyond that I completed a Master of Arts degree in public (applied) history. My thesis is titled "Trapped in the Fur Trade: Debt Bondage in the Rocky Mountains 1822-1827."</h6><br />

        <h6>Kristopher Skelton is a front end web developer who specializes in responsive web design. He burned through “Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML in 14 Days” just after high school and kept up with web development as a hobby. His career has spanned medical billing and professional history, as well as paraprofessional education. In 2015 he successfully completed certificate programs in JavaScript and advanced Front-End Web Development through Code Fellows in his hometown of Seattle. Recent projects include technologies such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, Node, Express, Mongo, Sass, React and Git version control. He enjoys solving complex problems as part of a small team. His current hobbies include table top games such as 7 Wonders, Dominion and Power Grid, and he float-tested his twenty-sided dice to ensure fair rolls during D&D games.
</h6>
        <br />
        <h6>Though still a junior-level developer, he has a solid training base, knows how to ask the questions to figure out a solution to his problems, and knows how to use development environment tools. Before he changed careers to web development he worked for over 13 years in all aspects of the medical billing cycle, mostly in the corporate setting. <br />
        He has an AAS in aerospace engineering and a MA in applied history. This diverse educational background combines with years in the professional world to influence all of his work. He is comfortable considering a problem from multiple angles while making quick decisions. He takes ownership of these decisions and follows them through until they are completed.</h6>
